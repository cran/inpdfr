#' inpdfr: A package to analyse PDF Files Using Ecological Tools.
#'
#' The inpdfr package allows analysing and comparing PDF/TXT documents using both
#'   classical text mining tools and those from theoretical ecolgy. In the later,
#'   words are considered as species and documents as communities, therefore
#'   allowing analysis at the community and metacommunity levels.
#' The inpdfr package provides three cathegories of functions:
#' functions to extract and process text into a word-occurrence data.frame,
#' functions to analyse the word-occurrence data.frame with standard and ecological tools, and
#' functions to use inpdfr through a Gtk2 Graphical User Interface.
